During this presentation we ask that you provide a brief summary of the Oracle Cloud Products you have investigated, and that you feel are of interest and relevance. You can find the information you need from Oracle's main [Cloud Home Page](https://cloud.oracle.com/) website. From this website you can investigate Oracle's three categories of Cloud Offerings: [Platform as a Service](https://cloud.oracle.com/en_US/paas), [Infrastructure](https://cloud.oracle.com/en_US/iaas) and [Software as a Service](https://cloud.oracle.com/en_US/saas). Note: The job for which you are applying will focus primarily on **Platform as a Service** and **Infrastructure as a Service**.  

When providing your Oracle Cloud Product Presentation, you have two options. With both these options, if you choose to use Powerpoint, please keep your presentation to 5 slides or less. 

- **Option 1** - Oracle Cloud Investigation and Demo:

    This option is prefered, but not required. We will provide more detail on how to acquire an [Oracle Trial](#Oracle-Trial-Account) account below, but in summary, using an Oracle Trial account you can investigate any of the Oracle **Infrastructure** or **Platform** Cloud Services, and present what you learned about your experience and interest in these products. Many of Oracle's **Platform** Services (e.g: Application Container Cloud Service, Container Cloud Service, Developer Cloud Service, Oracle Database\/MSQL Cloud Services and Java Cloud Service provide simple demonstrations. Example are also available using Oracle's **Infrastructure** Cloud Services.
