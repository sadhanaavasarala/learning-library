## Client Environment Options

- **IMPORTANT** - Under my services, select from the drop down list the correct data center and click on **My Services**. If you are unsure of the data center you should select, and this is an in-person training event, ***ask your instructor*** which **Region** to select from the drop down list. If you received your account through an Oracle Trial, your Trial confirmation email should provide a URL that will pre-select the region for you.

- Care must be taking when setting your replication policy, because it cannot be changed. With Trial accounts, the first option available will generally set the replication policy sufficient for this workshop, so we will take the Default, and click on the **Set** button.
