Update: March 24th, 2017

## Introduction

This is the first of several labs that are part
of the **Oracle Public Cloud DevOps workshops**. This workshop will walk
you through building an automated Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC)
pipeline using the Oracle cloud and third party tools

This new pipeline will compile code, build environments in the cloud,
and deploy the code into the new environment. You will assemble this
pipeline leveraging Developer Cloud Service, Jenkins, Oracle Cloud
Orchestrations, and Chef. You will take on 2 Personas during the
workshop. The stack automation engineer will assemble the pipeline and
make it available for developers. The developer will leverage the new
SDLC stack and check in code leveraging the pipeline.

At the end of the workshop you will have deployed a new application in
the Oracle cloud as the developer persona leveraging the pipeline to
complete all the tasks after the code is checked into source control.

-   When prompted for a Passphrase enter **Summer15\#**. You are now
    connected to your newly create Jenkins instance.

    ![](images/100/image61.png)

### **STEP 12**: Test Jenkins

    ***Note:** Jenkins is a continuous integration and continuous
    delivery application, used to automate parts of the SDLC. Jenkins
    can be leveraged to build and test software projects continuously
    making it easier for developers to integrate changes to the project,
    and making it easier for users to obtain a fresh build. It also
    allows for continuous delivery of software by providing powerful
    ways to define build pipelines and integrating with many testing and
    deployment technologies.*

-   Open a browser and enter the **Public IP** for your newly create
    instance. The Jenkins login page should render as shown below.

    ![](images/100/image62.png)

-   Click **log in** and enter the following credentials:

    **User**: `opcmasterchef`

    **Password**: `Summer15#`

    ![](images/100/image63.png)

## Configure the Server for work

### **STEP 13**: Configure Chef client (Knife)

-   Switch back to your **SSH** session. Switch to the **jenkins** user
    and change to the home directory

    ```
    sudo -s

    su jenkins

    cd /home/jenkins
    ```

    ![](images/100/image64.png)

    -   Run script **downloadcheffiles.sh** to load the needed chef
    configuration files. ***Note***: The instructor will supply each group with an **Organization Id**. For our example, we will be using Org Id 1.

    `./downloadcheffiles.sh <Username> <Password> <ID Domain> <groupnumber>`

    ![](images/100/image65.png)

-   Notice that the **.chef** directory now contains 3 files:

    ![](images/100/image66.png)

-   Verify your connectivity to the Chef Server

knife environment list

    ![](images/100/image67.png)

### **STEP 14**: Download WebLogic Maven dependencies

-   Run the script **downloadWLSMavenfiles.sh** to install WebLogic
    Maven dependencies. Run to the following command:

    `./downloadWLSMavenfiles.sh <Username> <Password> <ID Domain> <groupnumber>`

    ![](images/100/image68.png)

    ![](images/100/image69.png)

### **STEP 15**: Load Cookbooks to Chef

-   **Clone** the Git repository that contains the Cookbooks that will
    be used during the lab.

    `git clone https://github.com/oraclenassolutionengineering/Chef\_Cookbooks`

    **Note:**

    -   **git** is a source control tool used by developers and now with
        the emergence of DevOps, “DevOps Full Stack Engineers” are using
        git as well for the code that decribes the infrastructure.

    -   A **Cookbook** is a term used by Chef. A cookbook is a set of
        recipes, attributes and other Chef files.

        -   A **recipe** is a set of instructions that run on the server
            that configure it.

        -   Attributes are set in cookbooks in the attributes folder

    -   The cookbook we are going to use for this lab has already been
        written and versioned into git. As the full stack engineer, you
        are going to clone the cookbook from the repo, configure it for
        your cloud environment and upload it to the new Chef
        organization.

    ![](images/100/image70.png)

### **STEP 16**: Configuring the Cookbook for your cloud environment

-   Change directories to the WebLogic cookbook:

    `cd /home/jenkins/Chef\_Cookbooks/opcwls`

    ![](images/100/image71.png)

-   We will now update the **cloud-environment.rb** file with your
    Identity Domain and password. Edit file **cloud-environment.rb** in
    **attributes** directory:

    `vi attributes/cloud-environment.rb`

    ![](images/100/image72.png)

-   Update **cloud\_identity\_domain** and **cloud\_password** with your
    credentials.

    ![](images/100/image73.png)

-   Install the WebLogic cookbook: **Note**: berks is a command that comes with a Chef Client installation,it is used to manage and upload cookbooks to a Chef server. The berks install command finds all dependencies defined in a cookbook and downloads them to the local machine.

    `berks install`

    ![](images/100/image74.png)

-   Upload Chef Cookbooks to Chef Server. **Note**: Nodes pull cookbooks from the Chef server; to make it
available to Chef Nodes, we must first upload it to the Chef server.

    `berks upload --ssl-verify false`

    ![](images/100/image75.png)

-   Verify the cookbooks uploaded correctly

-   knife cookbook list

    ![](images/100/image76.png)

# Lab 4 Application Development (Developer Persona)

## Create Developer Cloud Service Project

    **index.xhtml** file has been modified

    `git status`

    ![](images/100/image113.png)

-   Commit the changes to your local Git repository:

    `git commit –am “changed title to my name”`

    ![](images/100/image114.png)

-   Push changes to the Developer Cloud Service Git repository. When
    prompted enter your **OPC password**:

    `git push origin master`

    ![](images/100/image115.png)

### **STEP 25**: Automatic deployment of Application

-   Click **Jenkins** to navigate back to the home page. It may take a
    minute to begin, but you should see a job running as shown below.

    ![](images/100/image116.png)

-   From the main page jobs that are running will have the ball on the
    left blinking. It will take about 25 minutes for the job to
    complete.

    ![](images/100/image117.png)

-   While the job is running, we will explore both the Jenkins jobs and
    Chef Server.

## Exploring the Jenkins Server

### **STEP 26**: Explore Jenkins job wkshp\_build\_pipeline

**Description:** Jenkins is a continuous integration and continuous
delivery application, used to automate parts of the SDLC. Jenkins can be
leveraged to build and test software projects continuously making it
easier for developers to integrate changes to the project, and making it
easier for users to obtain a fresh build. It also allows for continuous
delivery of software by providing powerful ways to define build
pipelines and integrating with many testing and deployment technologies.

All the jobs you see listed on the home page are being used for this
lab. The master job is called **Wkshp\_build\_pipeline**. Click on the
link for that job.

-   Click on the job **wkshp\_build\_pipeline**

    ![](images/100/image118.png)

-   Click **Configure**

    ![](images/100/image96.png)

-   Click on the flow tab

    ![](images/100/image119.png)

Here you can see the various jobs getting called to build the
environment and deploy the application. This process is started by a
developer checking in a new version of their code. Creating that
communication between git and this job is something you will do in the
workshop today.

## Explore Chef

### **STEP 27**: Log into Chef Web Console

**Description:** Chef is configuration management tool written in Ruby
and Erlang. It uses a pure-Ruby, domain-specific language (DSL) for
writing system configuration "recipes". Chef is used to streamline the
task of configuring and maintaining a company's servers, and can
integrate with cloud-based platforms

-   Open a browser and enter **140.86.12.215**. The Chef Login page
    should render. Enter Username and Password and click **Sign In**

    **Username**: `sdlcwkshpgroup<Organization Id>`

    **Password**: `Summer15#`

    ![](images/100/image121.png)

Notice the Nodes are empty; the last lab of the workshop will create
nodes as part of the Jenkins build process; be sure to check this screen
again at the end of the workshop

-   As the new server is being built by Jenkins it is being
    automatically registered to the Chef Server and assigned a role

    -   Once the new server is registered with Chef it is downloading
        all of the required cookbooks(a collections of recipes) to
        configure the server correctly

        ![](images/100/image122.png)

        Earlier when you ran the Berks command, you uploaded all the
        cookbooks required for this workshop.

-   To see the cookbooks you uploaded earlier, click on the “Policy” tab
    on the top of the page.

    -   Select Cookbooks on the left side menu

    -   Highlight any cookbook to see details about that cookbook

        ![](images/100/image123.png)

## Verify Application Deployment

### **STEP 28**: Verify Application Deployment

-   Click **Jenkins** to navigate back to the home page.

    ![](images/100/image124.png)

-   After about 25 minutes you will see success. You new WebLogic
    environment and application is now running.

    ![](images/100/image125.png)

-   Switch back to Oracle Public Cloud. If not already on main dashboard
    click **dashboard**

-   Click **Compute** navigation icon and select **Open Service
    Console**

    ![](images/100/image126.png)

-   Notice that a new compute instance **MT\_Server-1** has been
    created. Copy **Public IP** of newly created instance.

    ![](images/100/image127.png)

-   Along with the provisioning of a new compute instance, WebLogic was
    installed and your sample application has been deployed. Access
    application using the URL and the Public IP of your new **MT\_Server-1**
    
    `<IP>:7001/basicWebapp`

    ![](images/100/image128.png)

-   You have completed the lab.
